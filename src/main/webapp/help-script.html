    The code in this box is executed <em>after</em> your source has been checked out, but before your build steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the script fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the build is failed.</li>
      <li>If it succeeds, the output is expected to be lines of <tt>KEY=VALUE</tt> pairs that will be injected into the environment variables. The output is parsed using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)">java.util.Properties</a>.</li>
      <li>The output is expected to be UTF-8 encoded.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want a non-standard shell to execute your code, there is support for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang syntax</a>". To run custom interpreters, just make the first line of your script <tt>#!/usr/bin/my_interpreter</tt>.
